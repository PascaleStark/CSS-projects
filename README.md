# CSS-projects

# Description

In this repo, I have included **three** CSS projects that were built in the context of the advanced CSS and Sass course by Jonas Schmedtmann:
[Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/). In all projects, I use SASS preprocessor that is compiled to CSS using the ```node-sass``` npm package (see ```package.json``` file).

- First Project: Natours
In this project, I use CSS Floats and Layouts along with CSS properties such as the background-clip property, the outline-offset property, the transition/transform properties, custom animation timing functions using the cubic bezier curves, perspective, backface-visibility, shape-outside and float to make text flow around a shape, the object-fit property etc.

- Second Project: Trillo
In this project, I practice advanced flexbox alignment techniques along with other CSS properties and techniques such as generating and using SVG sprites in HTML and using CSS masks with mask-image and mask-size etc.

- Thrid Project: Nexter
In this project, I practice CSS grids.
